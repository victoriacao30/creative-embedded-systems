# Wired for Love :heart:
*A Heart-Shaped 555 Timer LED Pendant*

## Project Overview 
Wired for Love is a heart-shaped PCB pendant powered by a 555 timer that creates a blinking LED. The project explores how functional circuitry can be shaped into expressive, creative art. Designed for Valentine’s Day, the blinking LED acts as a small “heartbeat.”

This project was created as part of a PCB fabrication assignment focused on layout design, CNC milling, and soldering. 

## Components: 
- TL555 timer
- 1x LED
- Resistor R1 and R2 (timing resistors), R3 (LED current-limiting resistor)
- Capacitors C1 (timing capacitor), C2 (10nF decoupling capacitor)
- 3.7V coin cell battery
- Coin cell battery holder

## Building Process:
1. Design schematic in KiCad.
2. Create heart-shaped board outline using Edge.Cuts.
3. Route traces to fit within the heart form.
4. Export files for CNC milling.
5. Milled PCB.
6. Soldered all components.
7. Powered using a 3V coin cell battery.
